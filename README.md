# CrimsonSpace

The "Viewer" part in the MVC (Model-Viewer-Controller) multiverse. It´s the web headquarter written in HTML5 that will guide you as the GUI in the CrimsonUniverse. All features first turn up here.
The buttons are based on the free wonderful “Glasklart Theme” available for iOS and also for Android. I rebuild them with CSS for all the different worlds in this universe accordingly. Only the remaining icons self remain as images. Some of the features are password protected because of possible miss use of passwords or tokens. The page is designed upon pure CSS and also has a responsive design for Android/iOS or Windows Phone. I tried to cut out all unnecessary parts to have a plain look& feel and to reduce page load times.
